      <description>My new favorite sport is soccer, more commonly referred to worldwide as football. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s a very un-American thing to do, actually like soccer. But I don&amp;rsquo;t care. The leagues are fascinating to follow. The players are from all over the world. There seems to be a more authentic level of diversity in the world of soccer. And I kind of like diversity lately. Call me crazy.
The teams I like are cities I&amp;rsquo;ve been to: Seattle Sounders FC, Manchester City, and Bayern Munich.</description>
