      <description>Sitting in a Starbucks, writing this before my battery fails. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning about vulnerability, and wanting more of it in my life. There&amp;rsquo;s a really great book out called Daring Greatly, by Brene Brown.
In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s about: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent and Lead. It&amp;rsquo;s been an eye opener. Thanks to @LisaDJenkins for recommending the book. I wholeheartedly recommend it, too.</description>

What do future relationships look like? Not too far back our smart phones evolved, grew beyond their pixels, chips, buttons, and data plan coverage maps. Mobile device morphed into the primary conduit for ongoing emotional exchange, especially so when romance is involved â€” especially more pronounced when long distance romance is in play.</description>
