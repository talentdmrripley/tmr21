      <description>Roughly a year ago I started working from home because of COVID-19. There were lots of adjustments early on. I work in marketing so, really, I can perform that function anywhere with internet access.
METER Group, where I work, was able to stay open because it&amp;rsquo;s an essential business that helps food companies produce food. Production went to two shifts while most of the office staff shifted to wfh.
All in all, it&amp;rsquo;s been fine.</description>
