      <description>How many chances does one get in life, as allotted by God, or the powers that be &amp;ndash; those unseen forces moving behind life like stagehands doing what the big director tells them? It stands to reason, if you spend any time reasoning within the confines of faith, that chances are predetermined, or fixed. ( **Feel free to attack this question from a non-religious angle. We&amp;rsquo;re all friends here.)
Chances donâ€™t breed with other chances, they just exist until used up, or get missed.</description>
