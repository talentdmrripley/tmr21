        Courage Always Wins

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I have a little motto going: courage always wins. It&rsquo;s about looking fear in the eye, not blinking.
Not knowing the outcome — not needing to. I own the last word; it belongs to me. Fear can&rsquo;t leave unanswered questions; all the smudges on whichever lens I view the world.
Dared in that instant. Tried it. Wrote it. Said it. Walked in/out. Asked. Answered boldly. Fought for it.
Loved.
Success. Failure.

      I shot for average growing up and that’s what I got. School was no cake walk, but it wasn’t hard or anything. Learning bored me. Homework? What’s that? I got a lot of D’s on my progress reports, which sent my parents into the stratosphere over and over again. They threatened me within an inch of my life over and over, and I would rally across the finish line, and hold my hands up in victory for average, for a fucking C.

      Too much nutsack or not enough. That&rsquo;s it. Too much nutsack and the by-product of boldness, courage, and self assuredness always at the ready. Or not enough nutsack and the by-product of timidness, hesitation, and self doubt are the order of the day.
Simple things like speaking up in a crowd or a propensity for picking fights means you probably have a surplus in the nutsack department. By contrast, bolting from conflict, constanly caving to the wants of others, or shrinking like a violet in the face of almost anything can safely be assessed as having too little nutsack.

      Am I happy at my job? Does my career challenge me month after month? How does my job make me feel? These are just a few questions we ask ourselves as we navigate our careers.
Habit trackers are a cornerstone of Bullet Journaling. #BuJo users track all kinds of habits, mine being fairly simple: reading, working out, and work happiness.
How did I feel when I left work today? Work Happiness is a daily question and a score:

      She is one of those words in bold print on the pages of your life story. Clarity. It means having the quality of being certain or definite. Clear. Her only purpose, as it relates to how we process the world around us, is to convey that this &ndash; whatever this is &ndash; is important.
Routine becomes vague; the path familiar; the pace: machine-like and automatic; the challenges many; the needs plenty.

      I have a little motto going: courage always wins. It&rsquo;s about looking fear in the eye, not blinking.
Not knowing the outcome — not needing to. I own the last word; it belongs to me. Fear can&rsquo;t leave unanswered questions; all the smudges on whichever lens I view the world.
Dared in that instant. Tried it. Wrote it. Said it. Walked in/out. Asked. Answered boldly. Fought for it.
Loved.

      She is one of those words in bold print on the pages of your life story. Clarity. It means having the quality of being certain or definite. Clear. Her only purpose, as it relates to how we process the world around us, is to convey that this &ndash; whatever this is &ndash; is important.
Routine becomes vague; the path familiar; the pace: machine-like and automatic; the challenges many; the needs plenty.

They threatened me within an inch of my life over and over, and I would rally across the finish line, and hold my hands up in victory for average, for a fucking C.

Big Raunch poached somebody else’s turf, so he and Candy had to slink back a ways, set up shop off the main drag, so to speak.

      How many chances does one get in life, as allotted by God, or the powers that be &ndash; those unseen forces moving behind life like stagehands doing what the big director tells them? It stands to reason, if you spend any time reasoning within the confines of faith, that chances are predetermined, or fixed. ( **Feel free to attack this question from a non-religious angle. We&rsquo;re all friends here.)
Chances don’t breed with other chances, they just exist until used up, or get missed.

      A rashful reminder remains from my stroke. The drug that saved my life (the me inside of me), tPA (tissue plasminogen activator, fancy for heavy duty clot-buster), didn&rsquo;t take the first time. They shot it into my arm and they missed; the drug stayed there, though, festered under the skin and soggy like spilled milk under a newspaper. The trauma team eventually found purchase in a vein with another dose, though, sparing my brain.

      Take a walk, friend. Change it up. Move your paws, nose the ground. Run it &lsquo;round and &lsquo;round, like a Hoover vacuum, over and over and back again. Secrets dangle from the blades of grass, like shimmering drops of morning dew. Stop. Sniff out the stories. Draw in the odiferous. Write your own story in the prickly green. Share it. Life is not a journey to somewhere else. Wag instead in the wideness of now.

      A rashful reminder remains from my stroke. The drug that saved my life (the me inside of me), tPA (tissue plasminogen activator, fancy for heavy duty clot-buster), didn&rsquo;t take the first time. They shot it into my arm and they missed; the drug stayed there, though, festered under the skin and soggy like spilled milk under a newspaper. The trauma team eventually found purchase in a vein with another dose, though, sparing my brain.

      Dogs pee on things. A lot. And they like peeing on things, a lot. Fresh patches of grass and wall to wall carpeting present perfect places to piss. Add to that: street corners, bushes, pathways, sidewalks, fire hydrants, trees, park benches, swing sets, car tires, mailboxes, flagpoles, and flowers. Nothing on the ground is safe from a raised leg and urine to spare.
It&rsquo;s much more than just a birthright. They&rsquo;re programmed to mark territory, claim it as their own.

      I shot for average growing up and that’s what I got. School was no cake walk, but it wasn’t hard or anything. Learning bored me. Homework? What’s that? I got a lot of D’s on my progress reports, which sent my parents into the stratosphere over and over again. They threatened me within an inch of my life over and over, and I would rally across the finish line, and hold my hands up in victory for average, for a fucking C.

Chances don’t breed with other chances, they just exist until used up, or get missed.

      Life seemed to be more fun when your life was out there somewhere, waiting in the future. It was mysterious and you would get to it eventually. Pieces would fit together like a happy puzzle of meaning and fulfillment.
From a thousand miles out the future looked perfect, or adequate at the very least. The perfect job would occupy your days with purpose, and the perfect spouse would occupy your nights with passion.

      She is one of those words in bold print on the pages of your life story. Clarity. It means having the quality of being certain or definite. Clear. Her only purpose, as it relates to how we process the world around us, is to convey that this &ndash; whatever this is &ndash; is important.
Routine becomes vague; the path familiar; the pace: machine-like and automatic; the challenges many; the needs plenty.

      Too much nutsack or not enough. That&rsquo;s it. Too much nutsack and the by-product of boldness, courage, and self assuredness always at the ready. Or not enough nutsack and the by-product of timidness, hesitation, and self doubt are the order of the day.
Simple things like speaking up in a crowd or a propensity for picking fights means you probably have a surplus in the nutsack department. By contrast, bolting from conflict, constanly caving to the wants of others, or shrinking like a violet in the face of almost anything can safely be assessed as having too little nutsack.

      Recurring dream: I&rsquo;m in our old house, the one we moved out of 9 years ago. I&rsquo;m panicked because the new owners have been waiting for us to move our things out. Our stuff and their stuff, miscellany, fills the house. At first they&rsquo;re not home. I start making an inventory and wander through each room. The living room still has our hunter green plaid couch and matching love seat, oak entertainment center, coffee table, computer desk, and kids craft table.

Apparently the neighbors bore my divorce well. They’re not speaking to me either. Neither are they waving. The waving has altogether stopped, as though deliberate and planned in secret. For gods sake don’t wave.

Fletch picked a spot at the top of the stairs, overlooking the front door and entryway. He waited for days, head lowered, ears peeled. It was everything a picture of vigilance. Cars passed by the house, sending his head up off the floor.

      Sitting in a Starbucks, writing this before my battery fails. I&rsquo;ve been learning about vulnerability, and wanting more of it in my life. There&rsquo;s a really great book out called Daring Greatly, by Brene Brown.
In a nutshell, it&rsquo;s about: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent and Lead. It&rsquo;s been an eye opener. Thanks to @LisaDJenkins for recommending the book. I wholeheartedly recommend it, too.
