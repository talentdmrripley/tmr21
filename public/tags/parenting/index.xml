      <description>Recurring dream: I&amp;rsquo;m in our old house, the one we moved out of 9 years ago. I&amp;rsquo;m panicked because the new owners have been waiting for us to move our things out. Our stuff and their stuff, miscellany, fills the house. At first they&amp;rsquo;re not home. I start making an inventory and wander through each room. The living room still has our hunter green plaid couch and matching love seat, oak entertainment center, coffee table, computer desk, and kids craft table.</description>

      <description>Knock-knock-knock on the door. Fast knocks. Hard knocks. I&amp;rsquo;m busy, dammit. Was busy. Knock-knock-knock, heavier, faster. Coming. I&amp;rsquo;m coming, little shit. Eyes press against the narrow glass next to the door, framed by little hands, like the inside of my house some kind of show, or worse a circus. I see him. He sees me. Busted. He slides out of view, waits.
I open the door. I know how it goes.</description>

      <description>Things are fine until they’re not. For gods sake don’t disrupt. Routines set like cheap glue. The pieces fit. They fit until they don’t. Deviations disrupt. Divorces disrupt. The cracks creep in. Cracks conspire. Pleasantville might crumble. Don’t disrupt.
Apparently the neighbors bore my divorce well. They’re not speaking to me either. Neither are they waving. The waving has altogether stopped, as though deliberate and planned in secret. For gods sake don’t wave.</description>
