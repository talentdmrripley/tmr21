      <description>My new favorite sport is soccer, more commonly referred to worldwide as football. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s a very un-American thing to do, actually like soccer. But I don&amp;rsquo;t care. The leagues are fascinating to follow. The players are from all over the world. There seems to be a more authentic level of diversity in the world of soccer. And I kind of like diversity lately. Call me crazy.
The teams I like are cities I&amp;rsquo;ve been to: Seattle Sounders FC, Manchester City, and Bayern Munich.</description>

      <description>Roughly a year ago I started working from home because of COVID-19. There were lots of adjustments early on. I work in marketing so, really, I can perform that function anywhere with internet access.
METER Group, where I work, was able to stay open because it&amp;rsquo;s an essential business that helps food companies produce food. Production went to two shifts while most of the office staff shifted to wfh.
All in all, it&amp;rsquo;s been fine.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t self reject. It&amp;rsquo;s the best piece of advice I&amp;rsquo;ve heard in a long time.
That&amp;rsquo;s it. Apply for the job. Post the picture. Submit the article. Share the idea. Call the girl. Take a chance. That’s all.
Don’t self reject.</description>

      <description>Am I happy at my job? Does my career challenge me month after month? How does my job make me feel? These are just a few questions we ask ourselves as we navigate our careers.
Habit trackers are a cornerstone of Bullet Journaling. #BuJo users track all kinds of habits, mine being fairly simple: reading, working out, and work happiness.
How did I feel when I left work today? Work Happiness is a daily question and a score:</description>

      <title>Bullet Journaling: 7 Takeaways</title>

      <description>Back in January, I downloaded Ryder Carroll&amp;rsquo;s book, The Bullet Journal Method.
 For years, Ryder Carroll tried countless organizing systems, online and off, but none of them fit the way his mind worked. Out of sheer necessity, he developed a method called the Bullet Journal that helped him become consistently focused and effective.
 I decided to give Bullet Journaling a try. And while the book is straightforward with a great framework for getting started, you have to find your own way with it.</description>
