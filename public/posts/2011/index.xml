      <description>How many chances does one get in life, as allotted by God, or the powers that be &amp;ndash; those unseen forces moving behind life like stagehands doing what the big director tells them? It stands to reason, if you spend any time reasoning within the confines of faith, that chances are predetermined, or fixed. ( **Feel free to attack this question from a non-religious angle. We&amp;rsquo;re all friends here.)
Chances donâ€™t breed with other chances, they just exist until used up, or get missed.</description>

      <description>Life seemed to be more fun when your life was out there somewhere, waiting in the future. It was mysterious and you would get to it eventually. Pieces would fit together like a happy puzzle of meaning and fulfillment.
From a thousand miles out the future looked perfect, or adequate at the very least. The perfect job would occupy your days with purpose, and the perfect spouse would occupy your nights with passion.</description>

      <description>She is one of those words in bold print on the pages of your life story. Clarity. It means having the quality of being certain or definite. Clear. Her only purpose, as it relates to how we process the world around us, is to convey that this &amp;ndash; whatever this is &amp;ndash; is important.
Routine becomes vague; the path familiar; the pace: machine-like and automatic; the challenges many; the needs plenty.</description>
