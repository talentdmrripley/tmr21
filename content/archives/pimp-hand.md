Big Raunch sold tricks and Candy was his best seller. He lurked in the shadows, keeping an eye on his prized mule. It was 2 AM in the city. A fresh rain bathed the streets, but not enough to douse the rotten stench bouquet of trash and shit and piss and booze and vomit. 

Big Raunch poached somebody else’s turf, so he and Candy had to slink back a ways, set up shop off the main drag, so to speak. He flunked out of school but he wasn’t stupid. Big Raunch hated books, but not more than he hated big shots thinking they could tell him what to do. He knew that the more discriminating Johns would shop around, save a few bucks by sniffing for tail off the beaten path. And a fast nickel was better than a slow dime any day.

Candy looked up and down the street, looked deeply into cars looking for the look that looked for sex. She’d done okay that night, and felt she’d earned a little break. 

“Baby,” she said, “let’s eat.”

Big Raunch didn’t talk as much as he spit at people when he formed words in his mouth and unleashed them with cruel and unusual malice. 

“Quiet, mule,” he spat, suddenly. Little droplets of saliva sprang from his mouth like a shotgun blast, each alcohol laced drop of saliva hitting their respective marks all over Candy’s cheaply made up face, which was heavy on the rouge, lipstick, eyeliner, and a hundred other magic tricks designed to turn complete hideousness into “hell, why not?”

“I don’t pay you to eat food…” He raised his hand, a fresh smack in order, to restore the order of things.

Suddenly, an unmarked patrol car pulled into the alley. A four-door sedan, late 90s model Chevy – it screamed 5-0, what with its dull rims and dull paint and dull looking vice cop manning the wheel. Big Raunch grabbed Candy by the waist, gently, and forced her close. The thought of kissing her turned his stomach into a festering wave of queasy uneasiness, the places her mouth had been that very evening, which was hot and muggy and thick with humanity. He had no choice. Big Raunch planted his boozed up lips on her lipstick caked mouth and kissed her like love wasn’t a mystery anymore, not for this gruesome twosome stealing kisses in a darkened alley, an alley any stray cat would avoid like the plague.

The vice cop had seen better performances. He let them let them think they’d been fooling him the whole time.  He knows a good show when he sees one, and most of vice-copping is watching scum act normal. The pimps and pushers, hookers and halfwits, dealers and dopes, lowlifes and less-thans. Casual is their currency, and they spend it like drunken sailors.  Therefore, they stand out like sore thumbs against the backdrop of normal: the real boring, the real casual.  Real life.  They tried too hard to blend.  Like a gaggle of goths, bound by their will to resist conforming, the irony is lost on them.

The long, wet, sloppy kiss waned, thankfully.  Big Raunch looked over his shoulder, at the same time Candy looked over his shoulder, watching the watchful gaze of the vice cop.  Their eyes danced in a triangle of lies, recognition betraying their faces.  Busted.  The cop knew Big Raunch and Candy both, though both were none the wiser as to how; snitches the both of them.    

The vice cop rolled his window down, looked over the ally both ways, seeing it was safe.

“Candy,” he said, just her name.  She flinched, squirmed, tried to collect herself.  Too late.  Big Raunch’s eyes burned, his mouth folded into itself, contemptuous and cruel.  

“Sorry, Raunch,” she whimpered like a dog.  “I…..”

The vice cop cut her off. He knew Big Raunch had a temper.

“Keep that pimp hand strong, Raunch,” he said, “keep it strong.”
