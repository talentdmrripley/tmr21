I have a little motto going: courage always wins.
It's about looking fear in the eye, not blinking.

Not knowing the outcome â€” not needing to.
I own the last word; it belongs to me.
Fear can't leave unanswered questions;
all the smudges on whichever lens I view the world.

Dared in that instant. Tried it. Wrote it. Said it.
Walked in/out. Asked. Answered boldly. Fought for it.

Loved.

Success. Failure. Living.
