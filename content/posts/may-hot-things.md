May was a fast month with some milestones. Not only is the fog of the pandemic lifting and we're able to move in the direction of normal again, there were some brand new additions to reality as I know it.

### 1. Grand entrance 

First, we welcomed our first grandchild, Lana Jane, into the family on May 18th. She's a great baby so far and I really like holding her. Lana's parents are doing a great job and it's fun to watch them work together and love on their first child.

There's something about when your babies have babies that you finally feel semi-successful as a parent. Is that true for anyone else? That's true in my case.

Being a grandpa to a brand new granddaughter is all so new. I adore this little human quite a bit, and want to spend time with her without being too annoying to her parents. We'll see how it all goes :)


### 2. Working from work

Getting vaccinated in April meant I could work from work in May. It was time to go back. While working from home during the pandemic worked out, it really doesn't gel with my preferred work arrangement: at work. The commute is super easy but it's enough transition to properly set my mind on work for the day versus getting up and walking to the other side of the house. 

Sure, it's less than 25 steps to the den but you pass the living room, kitchen, the garage door, and laundry room on your way to "work." The den is comfy and bathed in daylight. Bottomless coffee and snacks always nearby. 

Home is a distracting oasis, your possessions and your pets chipping away at your attention. Week after week, month after month, just looping in an out of work time. 

Some people "love it" as articles profess the woke magic of working from home. Are these people freelance writers? They've always worked from home. 

No matter. They can have it. I'll work at work thank you.

### 3. Watching live sports

May was great for spectators and spectating. The pandemic brought everything to a halt in 2020 for school and school sports. As school looked different to finish 2020 into 2021, school sports also looked different. 

The threat of no seasons, shortened seasons, and seasons that made no sense in normal times, i.e. "Spring Football." No fans to 1-2 fans per athlete. My wife is the high school swim coach. They compete in virtual swim meets. No state tournaments. 

Just weird all around. Like, baseball finishing in the middle of May so kids could start playing basketball. Huh? Yeah. Hopefully Fall 2021 will get back to normal for schools and school athletes.

But watching the sports again has been pretty fabulous. Having dates on the calendar again to watch sports again is great.

### 4. Half marathons

Not really for me personally, but my wife completed two half marathons in May. She's training for a Half Ironman in September. Both runs went very well for her this month, taking 1st and 6th in her age group respectively.

In the first race she paced 9:18 over 13.1 miles and on the second race she knocked that down to a 8:46. Pretty impressive. I'm really proud of her.
