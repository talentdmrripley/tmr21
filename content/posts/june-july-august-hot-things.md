- Marketing team work week in Pullman
- Trailside Brewery and Red Card Pub in Pullman, getting to know others
- Video project at work and learning new skills
- Bonuses at work for hitting goals
- New floors (buh-bye carpet)
- Competitive baseball is getting better to watch

### Losses
- Boating only a couple times this summer
- Taking on more work, responsibility for same pay
- Minimal connection with wife who trains and travels all the time
- No major vacation for the second year in a row
- Not enough camping, overnights, over-landing
- Competitive baseball undermined by politics and dad-coaching
