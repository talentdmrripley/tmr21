Roughly a year ago I started working from home because of COVID-19. There were lots of adjustments early on. I work in marketing so, really, I can perform that function anywhere with internet access.

[METER Group](https://metergroup.com), where I work, was able to stay open because it's an essential business that helps food companies produce food. Production went to two shifts while most of the office staff shifted to wfh. 

All in all, it's been fine. I'm thankful to be employed during a global pandemic and the econominc uncertainty it brought to many. In fact, our company has thrived a bit and has been hiring more staff each month.

We're not sure when we'll return to the office. I'm ready to work at work again I think, though, that could be another adjustment.
