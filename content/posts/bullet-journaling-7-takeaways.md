Back in January, I downloaded Ryder Carroll's book, [The Bullet Journal Method](https://www.amazon.com/Bullet-Journal-Method-Present-Design/dp/0525533338/ref=asc_df_0525533338/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312104274912&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4302620717105397799&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9033767&hvtargid=aud-798931705416:pla-524552078099&psc=1). 

> For years, Ryder Carroll tried countless organizing systems, online and off, but none of them fit the way his mind worked. Out of sheer necessity, he developed a method called the Bullet Journal that helped him become consistently focused and effective.

I decided to give Bullet Journaling a try. And while the book is straightforward with a great framework for getting started, you have to find your own way with it. 

#### Where to start?

The #BuJo hashtag is ripe with inspiration, ideas, hacks, colorful layouts, and "trackers" for organizing your life and logging particulars of note. Thousands of people share their layouts, make videos, and more. Check out the results in this [#BuJo Instagram search](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/bujo/) with 3,553,046 posts. There's quite a lot of cool things happening in the Bullet Journal universe.

That said, start with Rider Carroll's bulletproof framework. Learn it inside and out and grasp why Bullet Journaling is efficient. Intimidation awaits if you decide that your journal must match a constant, high level of creativity. My suggestion is don't try. Your style and creativity can emerge on its own, and that's great! 

You might need a nudge here and there, and people come up with 1000s of useful layouts. But again—I can't stress this enough—commit yourself to finding your own way with Bullet Journaling.

#### My 7 takeaways
1. Be consistent—There's great satisfaction in the ritual of Bullet Journaling.
2. Trackers—You can track almost anything. How did I feel when I left work? Did I exercise today? Did I read? What did I eat?
3. Writing things down—There's permanency in the act of writing something down. Disconnecting from the digital world might sound old-fashioned but it's refreshing in a surprising way. I encourage everyone to try it.
4. Perspective shift–Instead of moving through life at break-neck speed, Bullet Journaling turns you into an observer of your life and all the things you care about.
5. Embrace your individuality—It's your Bullet Journal; you might be surprised what you learn about yourself and your particular style.
6. No pressure—don't beat yourself up if you miss a week. If you started with the basics and got some momentum, it shouldn't be long until you're on top of things again.
7. Journaling—Since it's in the name and all, journaling your life is easy and organized throughout the year. How was that trip? How's work going? What's going on at home?

As for the actual journal, I'm a fan of the [Leuchtturm 1917 Medium A5 Dotted Hardcover Notebook](https://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm1917-Medium-Dotted-Hardcover-Notebook/dp/B002TSIMW4/ref=sxbs_sxwds-stvp?crid=2WMQHL5J2JD97&keywords=leuchtturm1917+journal&pd_rd_i=B002TSIMW4&pd_rd_r=d055a767-f86e-415f-b439-6301459bacba&pd_rd_w=Y3BdC&pd_rd_wg=NLJHE&pf_rd_p=a6d018ad-f20b-46c9-8920-433972c7d9b7&pf_rd_r=EQF938S70W46DRV9D2H7&qid=1572159392&s=books&sprefix=leuchtt%2Cstripbooks%2C212). The dotted grid makes layouts easy and efficient. That said, there are countless notebook options out there, folks. Go with what works for you.

I definitely recommend Bullet Journaling, especially if you're looking to connect with your life a bit more. I don't keep a digital calendar for my personal life; it's all in my Bullet Journal now.
