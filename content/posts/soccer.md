My new favorite sport is soccer, more commonly referred to worldwide as football. Yes, it's a very un-American thing to do, actually like soccer. But I don't care. The leagues are fascinating to follow. The players are from all over the world. There seems to be a more authentic level of diversity in the world of soccer. And I kind of like diversity lately. Call me crazy.

The teams I like are cities I've been to: Seattle Sounders FC, Manchester City, and Bayern Munich. When I got hooked, I hadn't realized how successful these teams were currently and in recent memory. I'm not a fair weather fan, just new.

The leagues not only play in their own countries but participate in major continental tournaments like Champions League, Europa, Concacaf and more. World Cup is every four years. The last one was in 2018 and I was captivated. The next world cup happens in 2022, so national teams are qualifying now. There's also the Olympics coming up this summer after being delayed last summer due to the COVID 19 worldwide pandemic.

It seems there is always a soccer match to watch and some international or national wrinkle to figure out, which makes it fun and dynamic. Compared to the static, hopelessly predictable seasons of North American MLB, NBA, NHL, and NFL, it's quite the breath of fresh air for a sports fan. Add to that the very lightweight load of commercial interruption during competitive play. It's brilliant for the clock to just keep going during injuries, penalties, scoring, substitutions, etc. They add a reasonable amount of "stoppage time" at the end of each 45-minute half, usually 2-3 minutes. 

I'm having a blast with soccer. Of course, my family thinks it's one more weird thing I like that they can't stand. And I'm super naive when it comes to knowing much about the leagues, clubs, players, politics, owners, sponsors, and rich histories of the sport. I'm also quite unaware of soccer's perceived corruption at the highest levels of soccer's governing bodies. Perhaps I'll learn more about that as I watch more, but for now, it's too much damn fun.
