So April 2021 has almost come to a close but here are the things asking for a fair bit of my attention this month. In no particular order:

### 1. Star Trek 
#### Lower Decks
I'm a big Star Trek fan in general, but I didn't jump right on to this show when it was released last fall. It's a streaming only show I usually need a compelling reason to subscribe to yet another streaming service just to watch one show. The good news is that it's included in [Paramount +](https://www.paramountplus.com/).

As a real fan, Lower Decks doesn't disappoint and it's quite a joy to binge watch. It's the lighter side of Star Trek and I love it. It's 100% Star Trek, credible feeling, authentic, and a riot! It's laugh out loud funny and has a lot of heart at the same time. 

#### Discovery
If you haven't figured out yet, I really like Star Trek. Discovery is no exception. The characters and story telling are top notch and entertaining season after season. Again, it's a streaming only series. [Paramount +](https://www.paramountplus.com/) makes it easy to binge watch.


### 2. Der Football
#### [Champions League](https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/)
	
8 teams started the month of April in the quarter finals and still in the hunt
	
- Bayern Munich (knocked out by Paris Saint Germain after two legs)
- Dortmund (knocked out by Manchester City after two legs)
- Liverpool (knocked out by Real Madrid after two legs)
- Porto (knocked out by Chelsea after two legs)
	
The semi final matchups are:

- Paris Saint Germain vs Manchester City (Man City leads 2-1 after 1st leg)
- Read Madrid vs Chelsea (1-1 after first leg)

The second leg of the semi finals is next week, with Man City hosting Paris Saint Germain and Chelsea hosting Real Madrid. Stay tuned!

#### [Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/)
Manchester City looks to be a lock to win the Premier League title again. Manchester United is in second place but unable to threaten MC's inevitable crowning result. Premier League, by most accounts (including this casual viewer's opinion) is the top professional league in the world. It's great fun to watch!
 
#### [Major League Soccer](https://www.mlssoccer.com/)

The Seattle Sounders FC got started on 4/16 with a home win and a clean sheet, 4-0, against Minneapolis FC. 
	
### 3. Hello Fresh

A co-worker sent us a free [Hello Fresh](https://www.hellofresh.com) box (that's how they hook you). Then you're signed up for a box each week. You have to stay on top of this otherwise you end up with a lot of food and a lot of charges. This is working out okay against the normal grocery bill because my wife is on a special diet and can't eat what my step son and I like to eat.

Each box comes with 3 complete meals. The variety of meals is staggering and the results are quite tasty, usually taking 30 minutes to prepare, cook, and serve.

Each meal is generally healthy (lower calories) and fresh. It saves other calories too like thinking about what to make for dinner, what to buy for dinner, and having to go grocery shopping for dinner. Cost per serving is around $8 - $10. 

### 4. Blogging

In March, I combined two blogs [talentdmrripley.com](https://talentdmrripley.com) and [half-lifed.com](https://half-lifed.com) into a single blog, [ripixl.com](https://ripixl.com) (a Square Space site). It felt like the right thing to do, but in April I played around more and more on the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator and learned to love it again. This site runs on Hugo!

So another change. I'll use ripixl.com for creative photos and Subaru updates, and continue publishing more personal blog posts like this one for talentdmrripley.com 

Why bother? Do people still do personal blogs? Does anyone read personal blogs? I don't know and I don't really care. It's an outlet and I need those in my life, too.

### 5. Paramount +

This was a good purchase in April and if you've read this far, you know [Paramount +](https://www.paramountplus.com/) is delivering a lot of value in the form of Star Trek and high level international soccer matches. It costs about as much as 1.5 trips to Starbucks a month. Worth it!
